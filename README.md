# Canteen Management System

This project is a canteen management system designed to streamline operations, manage customers, and provide a structured way to handle food stalls and table allocations. The system consists of the following Java classes:

- `CanteenICT.java`
- `Customer.java`
- `FoodStall.java`
- `Table.java`

## Project Structure

### 1. CanteenICT.java
This is the main class of the system, which may function as the central hub for initializing and managing the canteen environment. It coordinates interactions between customers, food stalls, and tables. Key functionalities may include:

- Managing the list of food stalls within the canteen.
- Tracking customer activities and orders.
- Ensuring tables are properly allocated and available for customers.

### 2. Customer.java
The `Customer` class represents individual customers who visit the canteen. This class likely includes:

- Attributes to store customer information, such as name, ID, and order history.
- Methods to handle customer actions like placing an order, making payments, and interacting with food stalls.

### 3. FoodStall.java
The `FoodStall` class represents a single food stall within the canteen. Each food stall may offer a specific type of cuisine or selection of food items. Key components of this class include:

- Attributes to store details about the stall, such as stall name, food items available, and pricing.
- Methods for managing inventory, processing customer orders, and interacting with the canteen system.

### 4. Table.java
The `Table` class represents tables available in the canteen for customer seating. This class likely includes:

- Attributes for table properties, such as table number, capacity, and availability status.
- Methods for reserving, releasing, and managing table occupancy.
